Last updated: ${LEGAL_LAST_UPDATED}

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Stella, including the desktop application, mobile companion app, backend services, and any related websites or APIs (collectively, the "Service"), operated by FromYou LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("FromYou," "we," "us," or "our").

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.


1. Beta Status

Stella is currently in beta. The Service is provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis. Features, pricing, availability, and functionality may change, be limited, or be discontinued at any time without prior notice. We make no guarantees regarding uptime, reliability, or the continued availability of any particular feature during the beta period.


2. Eligibility

You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Service. If you are under 18, you represent that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms on your behalf.


3. Accounts and Authentication

Anonymous Use — Stella can be used without creating an account. Anonymous users receive access to core functionality subject to rate limits.

Registered Accounts — You may optionally create an account using magic-link email authentication. If you create an account, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your login credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account.

Account Linking — If you upgrade from anonymous use to a registered account, any anonymous session data may be linked to your new account.


4. Description of the Service

The Stella Platform (Free) — Stella is a personal AI assistant that runs primarily on your local device. The platform is completely free and open source. It includes the desktop application (an Electron-based app that runs AI agent orchestration, tool execution, computer use, and data storage locally on your computer), the mobile companion app (a lightweight mobile client that connects to your desktop or provides an offline fallback chat), and the open-source codebase.

The Stella Provider (Paid LLM Service) — Separately, FromYou operates the Stella Provider, a managed LLM inference service that routes AI model requests to upstream providers on your behalf. The Stella Provider is the paid component of the Service — subscription plans and usage-based billing apply to LLM inference consumed through the Stella Provider. You are never required to use the Stella Provider; you may supply your own API keys (BYOK) and use the platform entirely for free.

Additional Backend Services — Our backend also provides authentication, an offline fallback responder, connector integrations (Slack, Discord, Telegram, etc.), the mod store, social features, and media generation capabilities.


5. Local-First Architecture and Your Data

Local Storage — Stella is designed with a local-first architecture. Your conversations, chat history, agent state, event transcripts, tool outputs, and personal data are stored locally on your device — not on our servers. We do not have access to this data.

No Cloud Storage of Conversations — We do not store your conversation content, prompts, or AI responses on our cloud infrastructure under normal operation. The sole exception is the offline responder described below.

Offline Responder — When your desktop application is not running or not reachable, you may interact with Stella through the mobile app or connected channels (Slack, Discord, etc.). In this case, your message is sent to our backend, processed by a minimal fallback AI agent, and a response is returned. These offline interactions are transient — they are processed in memory and are not persistently stored in our systems beyond what is required to deliver the response and record usage for billing purposes.

Discovery Signals — During onboarding, Stella may optionally collect signals from your device (browser bookmarks, installed applications, development environment, etc.) to personalize your experience. This data is processed and stored entirely on your local device. Contact information and personal identifiers are pseudonymized locally before use. Discovery categories involving sensitive data (messages, notes) are opt-in and disabled by default.

Connector Integrations — If you connect Stella to third-party platforms (Slack, Discord, Telegram, Google Chat, Microsoft Teams), inbound messages from those platforms are routed to your desktop device for local processing whenever possible. When your desktop is offline, the backend offline responder processes them transiently as described above. Connector routing metadata (connection identifiers, conversation mappings) is stored on our backend to facilitate message delivery.


6. Computer Use and Agent Autonomy

What Stella Can Do on Your Computer — Stella's AI agents can perform actions on your computer on your behalf, including but not limited to: reading, writing, editing, and deleting files and directories; executing shell commands and running scripts; browsing the web, clicking links, filling forms, and navigating websites; capturing screenshots and reading on-screen content; opening applications and interacting with your operating system; modifying Stella's own user interface and code; scheduling automated tasks that run in the background; and interacting with connected services and APIs.

Your Responsibility — You are solely and entirely responsible for all actions that Stella's AI agents perform on your computer and accounts. Stella acts as a tool under your direction. When you instruct Stella to perform a task, you authorize it to take the actions necessary to complete that task, including any intermediate steps the AI determines are needed.

You acknowledge and agree that: AI agents may take actions that produce unintended, incorrect, or irreversible results, including data loss, file deletion, unintended purchases, unauthorized access to services, or system damage. It is your responsibility to review, supervise, and verify the actions taken by AI agents. You should not grant Stella access to systems or accounts where unintended actions could cause harm you are unwilling to accept. FromYou does not control, review, or approve the specific actions an AI agent takes in response to your instructions. The AI's behavior is determined by the underlying language model, your prompts, your system configuration, and the tools available. FromYou is not liable for any loss, damage, cost, or consequence resulting from actions performed by Stella's AI agents on your device, accounts, or connected services, regardless of whether those actions were intended, expected, or authorized by you.

Safety Mechanisms — Stella includes certain safety mechanisms (e.g., command safety checks, network guards, security policies, confirmation prompts for sensitive operations). These mechanisms are provided as a convenience and are not guaranteed to prevent all harmful actions. You should not rely on them as a substitute for your own judgment and supervision.


7. AI Services and the Stella Provider

Managed LLM Inference (Stella Provider) — The Stella Provider is a managed LLM inference service. When you do not supply your own API keys, Stella routes AI model requests through our backend to upstream AI model providers. We resolve the underlying model on the server side. Your prompts and responses pass through our infrastructure in transit but are not stored by us beyond what is necessary for real-time processing and usage metering. The Stella Provider is the only paid component of the Service.

Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK) — You may configure your own API keys for supported AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.). When using BYOK, requests are sent directly from your device to the provider, and our backend is not involved in those AI calls. Your API keys are stored locally on your device in encrypted form. Using BYOK means you can use Stella entirely for free.

Third-Party AI Providers — Whether using the Stella Provider or BYOK, your prompts and data are processed by third-party AI model providers. These providers have their own terms of service and privacy policies. We do not control how third-party providers handle your data once it reaches their systems. FromYou is not responsible for the outputs, accuracy, or behavior of any third-party AI model.

Media Generation — Stella may offer media generation features (image, audio, video) through third-party providers. Media generation requests are processed by those providers and subject to their terms.


8. Subscription Plans and Billing

Free Use — The Stella platform is free to use. You can use all features of the desktop and mobile application at no cost by providing your own API keys (BYOK).

Stella Provider Plans — The Stella Provider LLM inference service offers a free tier with rate-limited access, as well as paid subscription plans (currently Go, Pro, Plus, and Ultra) with higher usage limits and access to additional AI models. Paid plans are billed monthly through Stripe.

Pricing Changes — All prices are subject to change at any time, including during the beta period. We will make reasonable efforts to notify active subscribers of pricing changes in advance. Continued use of a paid plan after a price change constitutes acceptance of the new pricing.

Usage Limits — Each plan includes usage allowances measured in token consumption. If you exceed your plan's limits, service may be temporarily throttled until the next billing period.

Cancellation — You may cancel your subscription at any time. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. No refunds are provided for partial billing periods.


9. Self-Modifying Capabilities

Stella's AI agents can modify the application's own user interface and functionality when instructed by you. These modifications are made locally via Vite hot-module replacement and are tracked in a local Git repository on your device. You may revert any self-modification at any time. You are responsible for reviewing and accepting changes made by the AI to your local Stella installation.


10. Mod Store

Publishing — You may publish modifications ("mods") to the Stella Mod Store. By publishing, you grant FromYou and other Stella users a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, install, and distribute your mod through the Service.

Installing — Mods are community-created and are not reviewed or endorsed by FromYou. You install mods at your own risk. We are not responsible for any damage, data loss, or security issues caused by third-party mods.

Prohibited Content — You may not publish mods that contain malware, violate any law, infringe third-party rights, or are designed to harm users or their systems.


11. Open-Source Software

Stella's platform is open source. Your use of the open-source code is governed by the applicable open-source license(s) in the repository. These Terms govern your use of the hosted Service (backend APIs, Stella Provider, Mod Store, etc.) which may include components, infrastructure, and services not covered by the open-source license.


12. Acceptable Use

You agree not to: use the Service for any unlawful purpose or to violate any applicable law or regulation; attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of the Service or its related systems; interfere with or disrupt the Service, servers, or networks connected to the Service; use the Service to generate content that is illegal, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable; circumvent any rate limits, usage restrictions, or access controls; reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble any proprietary component of the Service (this does not restrict your rights under the applicable open-source license for open-source components); use the Service to build a competing product or service by systematically extracting data from our backend APIs; or resell access to the Stella Provider or backend services without our written permission.


13. Intellectual Property

Our Rights — The Stella name, logo, and branding are the property of FromYou LLC. The hosted backend services, API infrastructure, and any proprietary components not released under an open-source license remain the intellectual property of FromYou.

Your Rights — You retain all rights to your data, conversations, and any content you create using the Service. You retain all rights to mods you create, subject to the license granted in section 10.

export const PRIVACY_POLICY = `Stella — FromYou LLC
Last updated: ${LEGAL_LAST_UPDATED}

This Privacy Policy describes how FromYou LLC ("FromYou," "we," "us," or "our") handles information when you use Stella, including the desktop application, mobile companion app, backend services, and related websites or APIs (collectively, the "Service").

Stella is built on a local-first, privacy-by-design architecture. The Stella platform is completely free and open source. We designed the system so that your personal data stays on your device. FromYou operates the Stella Provider, a managed LLM inference service, as a separate paid offering — this is the only component where your data transits our servers. This policy explains exactly what we do and do not collect, and the limited circumstances where data reaches our infrastructure.


1. Our Core Principle: Your Data Stays on Your Device

Stella runs primarily on your local machine. Unlike most AI assistants:

• Your conversations are not stored on our servers. Chat history, prompts, AI responses, agent state, and tool outputs are stored locally on your device in a local database.
• No account is required. You can use Stella anonymously without providing any personal information.
• The platform is open source. You can inspect exactly how your data is handled.


2. Information We Do NOT Collect

Under normal operation, we do not collect or store:

• Your conversations, prompts, or AI responses
• Files on your computer or files created, modified, or deleted by Stella's AI agents
• Screenshots, screen captures, or on-screen content read by the agent
• Websites visited, forms filled, or actions taken by Stella's browser-use capabilities
• Browser history, bookmarks, or browsing data (yours or the agent's)
• Contents of your messages, notes, or calendar
• Shell commands executed by the agent or their output
• Voice recordings or transcripts
• Any data discovered during onboarding personalization
• Your locally stored API keys
• Any record of what the AI agent does on your computer


3. Information Stored Locally on Your Device

The following data is created and stored entirely on your device and is never transmitted to our servers:

• Conversations and chat history — your interactions with Stella
• Agent state and event transcripts — runtime operation of the AI agent system
• Tool execution results — output from shell commands, file operations, web searches, browser actions
• Computer-use activity logs — records of agent actions (browsing, file edits, commands)
• Discovery signals — optional onboarding personalization data (browser bookmarks, apps, dev environment, etc.)
• Pseudonymized identity map — de-identification of personal names/contacts found during discovery
• Voice transcripts — records of voice interactions
• LLM API keys (encrypted) — your own provider credentials for BYOK use
• Local preferences and settings — theme, model preferences, configuration
• Self-modification history (Git) — tracking of AI-made UI changes for undo/revert
• Installed mods and skills — extensions you have installed
• Device identity keypair — cryptographic identity for your device
• Local SQLite database — persistent storage for all of the above

You have full control over this data. You can delete it at any time by removing the Stella data directory from your device or using the in-app reset function.


4. Information That Passes Through Our Servers

In limited circumstances, data transits our backend infrastructure:

Stella Provider (Managed LLM Inference) — The Stella Provider is our managed LLM inference service — the only paid component of Stella. When you use the Stella Provider (i.e., you have not configured your own API keys), your prompts are routed through our backend to a third-party AI model provider. During this process: your prompt and the AI response pass through our servers in transit to reach the upstream AI provider; we do not persistently store the content of your prompts or responses; we do log usage metadata for billing and rate-limiting purposes (timestamp, model used, token count, duration, success/failure status, and your owner ID if signed in or an anonymous device identifier). When using BYOK (your own API keys), requests go directly from your device to the AI provider and do not pass through our servers at all. In this case, the Stella platform is entirely free and we have zero visibility into your AI usage.

Offline Responder — When your desktop is offline and you interact with Stella via the mobile app or a connected channel (Slack, Discord, etc.), your message is sent to our backend and processed by a minimal fallback AI agent. The interaction is transient — it is processed in memory and not persistently stored beyond what is needed to deliver the response and record usage metadata.

Connector Message Routing — If you connect Stella to third-party messaging platforms (Slack, Discord, Telegram, Google Chat, Microsoft Teams), we store connection metadata (which external account is linked to which Stella account, conversation mapping identifiers) and transient message events (inbound and outbound messages held temporarily for delivery, with a short time-to-live, automatically cleaned up). We do not permanently store the text content of connector messages.


5. Computer Use and Agent Activity Data

Stella's AI agents can perform actions on your computer, including browsing the web, executing commands, reading and writing files, and interacting with applications. All data related to these activities is processed and stored entirely on your local device. Specifically:

• Websites the agent visits, forms it fills, and data it reads from web pages are processed locally and never sent to our servers.
• Files the agent creates, reads, modifies, or deletes remain on your local filesystem.
• Shell commands and their output are executed and stored locally.
• Screenshots and screen content captured by the agent stay on your device.
• The complete history of all agent actions is recorded in your local conversation log, which we cannot access.

The only exception is when the agent's actions require an LLM inference call (e.g., the agent needs to decide what to do next). In that case, the prompt sent to the AI model may contain context about the agent's current task, which passes through the Stella Provider — but is not stored. If you use BYOK, even this data never reaches our servers.


6. Information We Collect When You Create an Account

Account creation is optional. If you choose to sign in, we collect: your email address (for authentication via magic link sign-in and account identification), your name if provided (for display purposes), and your account creation timestamp (for account management).

We use Better Auth for authentication, with magic-link email sign-in. We do not collect passwords.


7. Billing Information

If you subscribe to a paid Stella Provider plan, payment is processed by Stripe. We store: Stripe customer ID (linking your account to Stripe), subscription status and plan (determining your access level), payment method brand and last 4 digits (displaying payment info in settings), billing period dates (usage window tracking), and usage totals in micro-cents (enforcing plan limits).

We do not store your full credit card number, CVV, or banking details. All payment processing is handled by Stripe under their privacy policy.


8. Device Information

When your desktop registers with our backend (for mobile bridge or connector functionality), we store: device ID (identifying your desktop for message routing), device public key (verifying device identity via cryptographic signatures), online status (determining whether to route to your device or the offline responder), platform — Windows/macOS (display purposes), and mobile bridge base URLs (allowing your phone to connect to your desktop).


9. Anonymous Device Usage

If you use Stella without an account, we track: an anonymous device identifier (for rate limiting) and request count and timestamps (for enforcing fair-use limits). This data is not linked to any personal identity.


10. Social Features

If you use Stella's social features (friend system, chat rooms, collaborative sessions), the following is stored on our backend: social profile (nickname, friend code), friend relationships, chat room membership and messages, and collaborative session metadata and file operations. Social features are opt-in and require a signed-in account.


11. Mod Store

If you publish a mod to the Stella Mod Store, we store the mod package, metadata (name, description, author), and release artifacts. Published mods are publicly visible to other Stella users.


12. Third-Party Services

Stella integrates with third-party services. When your data reaches these services, it is subject to their respective privacy policies. This includes AI model providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, etc.) when processing AI requests, Stripe when subscribing to a paid plan, fal.ai when using media generation features, messaging platforms (Slack, Discord, Telegram, etc.) when using connector integrations, and Convex for backend infrastructure. When using BYOK (your own API keys), AI requests go directly from your device to the provider — our servers are not involved.


13. Data Retention

• Local device data — until you delete it; we have no access to it
• Account information — until you delete your account
• Billing records — as required by law and for dispute resolution (typically 7 years for financial records)
• Usage metadata — rolling windows (5-hour, weekly, monthly); aggregates retained for billing reconciliation
• Transient connector events — automatically deleted after a short TTL (minutes to hours)
• Anonymous device usage — retained for rate-limiting purposes; periodically pruned
• Social data — until you delete your account or the relevant content


14. Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect data that does reach our infrastructure: encryption in transit (all communication uses TLS/HTTPS), secret encryption (user-provided secrets stored on our backend are encrypted using AES-256-GCM with a versioned master key system), local encryption (API keys stored on your device are encrypted locally), device identity (devices authenticate using Ed25519 cryptographic keypairs), rate limiting (multi-layer rate limiting protects against abuse), and provider redaction (AI responses are scrubbed of upstream provider details before being returned to you).


15. Your Rights and Choices

Access and Control — Because Stella stores data locally, you have direct access to and control over your data at all times. You can view, export, or delete your local data by accessing Stella's data directory, use the in-app reset function to clear all local data, revoke connected integrations at any time, and delete your account, which removes your account information, billing profile, social data, and published mods from our backend.

Discovery Opt-Out — During onboarding, each discovery category is individually selectable. The most sensitive category (Messages & Notes) is disabled by default and requires explicit opt-in. You can skip discovery entirely.

Anonymous Use — You can use Stella's core features without creating an account or providing any personal information.

BYOK — You can provide your own AI provider API keys to avoid routing prompts through our infrastructure entirely.


16. Children's Privacy

Stella is not directed to children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us and we will promptly delete it.


17. International Users

Our backend infrastructure is hosted in the United States. If you access the Service from outside the United States, your information (to the extent it reaches our servers, as described in this policy) may be transferred to and processed in the United States.


18. California Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident, you may have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Given Stella's local-first architecture, the personal information we hold on our servers is minimal (account email, billing data, device identifiers). You may exercise your rights to know, delete, or opt out by contacting us. We do not sell your personal information. We do not use your data for targeted advertising.


19. European Privacy Rights

If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom, you may have rights under the GDPR including the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing, data portability, and objection. Given that the vast majority of your data is stored locally on your device and never reaches our servers, these rights primarily apply to account information and billing data. Contact us to exercise these rights. Where we do process personal data, we rely on: (a) contractual necessity; (b) legitimate interests (security, abuse prevention); and (c) your consent (optional features).


20. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will indicate the date of the most recent revision at the top. For material changes, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you. Your continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.


21. Open Source Transparency

Stella's platform is open source. You can review exactly how data is handled by inspecting the source code. We believe this is the strongest form of privacy assurance — you don't have to take our word for it.
